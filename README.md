## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

- Had some difficulty working with pico css. The custom css kept conflicting with pico.
- Also I havent worked on a javascript / HTML / CSS project in while so I was rusty when it came to working with it.
